The programs were built on Raspberry Pi, a computer built on Raspbian which is something specifically built with Linux for Raspberry Pi. There were many programs and utilities and setup files already provided by our professor like the LCD and the extension cord that contained the controllable circuit by command. The host needs to open an accepting port for the client program to connect. Once the client is connected, there will be a user interface to click on buttons to change the current direction inside a given circuit connected to the host Raspberry Pi. Some limitations were found as we could not use something that goes along ".getObject()" like in Java to make our click-check much faster and clearer. When the client user wants to disconnect, he or she can press quit and send a message to the host that the client is disconnected and "reopens" its port to accept another one. Then the quit button from the host completely closes the port and shuts the program off.
